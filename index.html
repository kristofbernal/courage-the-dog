		<h2>About Courage</h2>

		<h3>Personality</h3>
		<p>Courage, due to his traumatic past, is often an anxious and shy dog. However, when his family -- especially his mother, Muriel -- is in danger, he gets all giddy and with all his strength, saves them from the mysterious dangers that arrive in Nowhere, Kansas. </p>

		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>Long story short: A clinic visit turns horrifying when a doctor made Courage's parents disappear. Courage flees and ends up next to a garbage dump, where she is seen by a lovely little lady named Muriel. After convincing her husband, Muriel takes Courage home and becomes their child, and then they live happily ever after. Not.</p>
